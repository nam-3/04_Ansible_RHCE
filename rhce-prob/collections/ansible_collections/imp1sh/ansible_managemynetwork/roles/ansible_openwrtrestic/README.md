# imp1sh.ansible_managemynetwork.ansible_openwrtrestic
This role sets up restic backup for your ansible node. This role will try to install the ssh public key to the target backup machine, so ideally it is managed by ansible, too.

> Since version 0.4.1 there was a major overhaul of this role. It supports defining multiple repositories now, so it can be backed up to multiple locations.

## Sample config

```yaml
openwrt_restic_backups:
  - name: "wasabi"
    repotype: "s3:https"
    targethost: "s3.eu-west-2.wasabisys.com"
    targetsubdir: "forelle" #this is the bucket in s3
    aws_access_key_id: "youraccesskey"
    aws_secret_access_key: "yourverysecretsecretkey"
  - name: "backup_to_siteA"
    repotype: "sftp"
    targetsubdir: "SiteX"
    targethost: "myhost.onsitea.com"
    sshkey_user: "backupuser"
    authuser: "backupuser"
    manage_ssh: true
    sources:
      - "/etc"
      - "/root"
  - name: "backup_to_borgbase"
    repotype: "rest:https"
    authuser: "secretusername"
    authpass: "secretpassword"
    targethost: "username.repo.borgbase.com"
    sources:
      - "/etc"
      - "/root"
```


> As OpenWrt doesn't create huge amounts of data you can very well use the free service of [borgbase] (https://www.borgbase.com/). They offer superb service for backing up your data either via borg or restic, which are both one of the best tools for encrypted backup.

## Fine tune your backup

Optionally you can define some settings per backup list item with the following attributes in a `openwrt_restic_backups` list element:
- keepdaily
- keepweekly
- keepmonthly

You define one encryption passphrase for all targets via:

```yaml
restic_encpassphrase: "yoursupersecretandlongpassphrase"
```
or you can define it on a target level. Target level definition always preceds global config setting.

Regarding the cron timings, you can use the defaults. This will result in randomized times not earlier than 01:01h and not later than 06:59h. You can modify the range by overriding the defaults in:
```yaml
openwrt_restic_cron_hourrange_start: 1
openwrt_restic_cron_hourrange_end: 6
openwrt_restic_cron_minuterange_start: 1
openwrt_restic_cron_minuterange_end: 59
```
If you don't want it to be random, you need to either set e.g.

```yaml
openwrt_restic_cron_hour: 3
openwrt_restic_cron_minute: 34
```

or set it as an attribute of a list item of `openwrt_restic_backups`
- `cron_hour: 9`
- `cron_minute: 0`

This restic role will automatically create a cron job, that writes a list of all installed packages to `/etc/config/installed.packages` every day at midnight.

## Typical commands
### List snapshots
```
restic -p /etc/resticpassword_<<your_destination>> snapshots -r sftp:backupuser@<<target_hostname>>:./<<subfolder>> /<<myhostname>>
```
e.g.
```
restic -p /etc/resticpassword_to_datacenter1 snapshots -r sftp:backupuser@backup1.example.com:./subfolder1/firewall1.example.com
```

### Restore
```
restic -p /etc/resticpassword_<<your_destination>> -r sftp:backupuser@<<target_hostname>>>:./<<subfolder>>/<<myhostname>> restore <<latest oder snapshot id>> --target /tmp
```
e.g.
```
restic -p /etc/resticpassword_to_datacenter1 -r sftp:backupuser@backup1.example.com:./subfolder1/firewall1.example.com restore ae2bd94c --target /tmp
```
instead of a specific snapshot you can just say `latest`.
```
restic -p /etc/resticpassword_to_datacenter1 -r sftp:backupuser@backup1.example.com:./subfolder1/firewall1.example.com restore latest --target /tmp
```
