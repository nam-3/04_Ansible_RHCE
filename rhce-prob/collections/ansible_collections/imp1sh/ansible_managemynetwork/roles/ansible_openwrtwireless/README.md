# imp1sh.ansible_managemynetwork.ansible_openwrtwireless

This ansible role manages wireless connectivity for your OpenWrt node. In the filesystem the config file is `/etc/config/wireless`. It manages wifi-devices on the one hand and wifi-interfaces on the other.
For possible attributes see the the [OpenWrt wifi docs](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/network/wifi/basic).
Best practice for a new device is to experiment with Luci and make your target config and then implement it in Ansible. This is a straight forward process as variable names correspond to UCI naming.

## Example Configuration

Interfaces:
```yaml
openwrt_wifi_interfaces:
  wifi1_5g:
    mode: "ap"
    device: "radio1"
    network: "INSECURE"
    encryption: "psk2"
    key: "asdfasdf"
    ssid: "wifi1"
  wifi2_5g:
    mode: "ap"
    device: "radio1"
    network: "SECURE"
    encryption: "sae"
    key: "asdfasdf"
    ssid: "wifi2"
  wifi3_5g:
    mode: "ap"
    device: "radio1"
    network: "MGMT"
    encryption: "psk2"
    key: "asdfasdf"
    ssid: "wifi3"
  wifi1_2g:
    mode: "ap"
    device: "radio0"
    network: "INSECURE"
    encryption: "psk2"
    key: "asdfasdf"
    ssid: "wifi1-legacy"
```
Devices:
```yaml
openwrt_wifi_devices:
  radio0:
    type: "mac80211"
    path: "pci0000:00/0000:00:02.5/0000:05:00.0"
    band: "2g"
    htmode: "HE20"
    channel: "auto"
    cell_density: 0
  radio1:
    type: "mac80211"
    path: "pci0000:00/0000:00:02.5/0000:05:00.0+1"
    band: "5g"
    htmode: "HE80"
    channel: "auto"
    cell_density: 0
```

## Managing multiple devices

Group up your devices by your needs. In this example there is one site with two different wifi cards.

group name: tags_asiarf_aw7915-npd
```yaml
openwrt_wifi_devices:
  radio0:
    type: "mac80211"
    path: "pci0000:00/0000:00:02.5/0000:05:00.0"
    band: "2g"
    htmode: "HE20"
    channel: "auto"
    cell_density: 0
  radio1:
    type: "mac80211"
    path: "pci0000:00/0000:00:02.5/0000:05:00.0+1"
    band: "5g"
    htmode: "HE80"
    channel: "auto"
    cell_density: 0
openwrt_wifi_interfaces_aw7915:
  wasgeistreiches_5g:
    device: "radio1"
  spargeltarzan_5g:
    device: "radio1"
  quagermark_5g:
    device: "radio1"
  wasgeistreiches_2g:
    device: "radio0"
  spargeltarzan_2g:
    device: "radio0"
  quagermark_2g:
    device: "radio0"
```
group name: tags_wle600vx
```yaml
openwrt_wifi_devices:
  radio0:
    type: "mac80211"
    path: "soc/d0070000.pcie/pci0000:00/0000:00:00.0/0000:01:00.0"
    band: "5g"
    htmode: "VHT80"
    channel: "auto"
openwrt_wifi_interfaces_wle600v:
  wasgeistreiches_5g:
    device: "radio0"
  spargeltarzan_5g:
    device: "radio0"
  quagermark_5g:
    device: "radio0"
```

group name: sites_StandortA
The `device` attribute is not set in the variables as it does not relate to the site but to the device type.
```yaml
openwrt_wifi_interfaces_standorta:
  wifi1_5g:
    mode: "ap"
    network: "INSECURE"
    encryption: "psk2"
    key: "asdfasdf"
    ssid: "wifi1"
  wifi2_5g:
    mode: "ap"
    network: "SECURE"
    encryption: "sae"
    key: "asdfasdf"
    ssid: "wifi2"
  wifi3_5g:
    mode: "ap"
    network: "MGMT"
    encryption: "psk2"
    key: "asdfasdf"
    ssid: "wifi3"
  wifi1_2g:
    mode: "ap"
    network: "INSECURE"
    encryption: "psk2"
    key: "asdfasdf"
    ssid: "wifi1-legacy"
```

In order to merge those `openwrt_wifi_interfaces_xyz` variables you place some actions in your playbook.
Playbook: role_openwrtwireless.yml
```yaml
- hosts: tags_access-point
  pre_tasks:
    - name: combine wifi interfaces with site Standort A
      set_fact:
        openwrt_wifi_interfaces: "{{ openwrt_wifi_interfaces|default({}) | combine(openwrt_wifi_interfaces_standorta, recursive=true) }}"
      when: openwrt_wifi_interfaces_standorta is defined
    - name: combine wifi interfaces with tag aw7915
      set_fact:
        openwrt_wifi_interfaces: "{{ openwrt_wifi_interfaces|default({}) | combine(openwrt_wifi_interfaces_aw7915, recursive=true) }}"
      when: openwrt_wifi_interfaces_aw7915 is defined
    - name: combine wifi interfaces with tag wle600v
      set_fact:
        openwrt_wifi_interfaces: "{{ openwrt_wifi_interfaces|default({}) | combine(openwrt_wifi_interfaces_wle600v, recursive=true) }}"
      when: openwrt_wifi_interfaces_wle600v is defined
  become: true
  roles:
    - imp1sh.ansible_managemynetwork.ansible_openwrtwireless

```
