# imp1sh.ansible_managemynetwork.ansible_qemuagent

[Source Code on GitHub](https://github.com/imp1sh/ansible_managemynetwork/tree/main/roles/ansible_qemuagent)

This role is very easy. It install the qemu guest agent. This makes handling of qemu guests much easier and I strongly suggest to use it.

You don't have to define any variables. Just use the role and the rest will be taken care of.

I tested it on

- FreeBSD
- **Debian**
- Ubuntu
- Alpine
- Fedora

but official support is only for the main focues, i.e. Debian.
